# Archive Manager
The Archive Manager is a tool I developed to help organize my own collection of personal files that I created or acquired over the years. This collection contains over 250,000 files with files dating back before the millennium (yes, I started programming when I was 10). This program is a successor to a series of shell scripts I wrote. 

This tool helps me to:
* Build a search index from a arbitrary directory structure (can be a single folder or an entire disk)
* Query said search index for specific files (matching certain criteria like regex or EXIF)
* Merge multiple indexes into a master index
* Compare an index with another (to determine likelihood / backed-upness on old drives)
* Detect duplicates within an index (to optimize my archive)
